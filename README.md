# Church Encoding

In mathematics, **Church encoding** is a means of representing data and operators in the Lambda calculus. The Church numerals are a representation of the natural numbers using lambda notation. The method is named for [Alonzo Church][Alonzo Church], who first encoded data in the lambda calculus this way.

The Church encoding is not intended as a practical implementation of primitive data types. Its use is to show that other primitive data types are not required to represent any calculation. The completeness is representational...more on [Wikipedia][church encoding wikipedia].

This library has been done for personal educational purpose and made public, it has been inspired by the work of [Marcelo Camargo][Marcelo Camargo].

## Code quality, tests and benchmarks

Every time changes are introduced into the library, [Github][github actions] run the
tests.

The library has tests written with [PHPSpec][phpspec].
Feel free to check them out in the `spec` directory. Run `composer phpspec` to trigger the tests.

Before each commit some inspections are executed with [GrumPHP][grumphp],
run `composer grumphp` to check manually.

The quality of the tests is tested with [Infection][infection] a PHP Mutation testing
framework,  run `composer infection` to try it.

Static analysers are also controlling the code. [PHPStan][phpstan] and
[PSalm][psalm] are enabled to their maximum level.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by sending Github pull requests. I'm quite reactive :-)

If you can't contribute to the code, you can also sponsor me on [Github][github sponsor] or [Paypal][paypal sponsor].

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md][changelog-md] for a changelog based on [git commits][git-commits].
